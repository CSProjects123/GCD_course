						NOTES:

LESSON 1
Creating a constant and binding it to a closure is exactly what the complier does when it sees a func statement. 


typealias -- you can use this to make shortcuts while programming. The format is "typealias newname=oldname"

functions and closures can return both functions and closures 

functions and closures are the same thing.

variable capture: suppose you have a varible declred within a fucntion and then you have another function define in the first function, after the varible is declared. Suppose the second function uses the variable. And the first function returns the second function. now, each return of the first function will have new copies of the variable for the second function which is being returned. i.e. they each capture a new copy of the varible.

variable capture makes swift a fucntional programming language. 

LESSON 2 

grand central dispatch makes asynchronous programming easier and safer by hiding threads from the developer

 GCD provides us with two types of queues - synchronous (serial) and asynchronous (concurrent)

 There is a special queue called the main queue - this queue handles the UI of your app

You can still have concurrent programming with Synchronous queues. We do have sperate threads running here. The differece between synchronous queues and asynchronous queues is tha the order in which the threads are being executed in the synchronous queue is predictable. 


There are three aspects to the basic functionality of GCD: 
1. create a queue - either from scratch or by reusing an existing queue ;
2. get the Main queue 
3. add a closure to a queue. 


GCD was written in C, not in Swift, so GCD is made of functions and types, not classes and objects. 

Following are the main functions in GCD:

dispatch_q_t  - Represents a queue
dispatch_q_create(): creates a queue from scratch. This takes two paramteres - name and type of the queue (serial or concurrent)

You can sepcify serial by passing in "DISPATCH_UEUE_SERIAL" or "nil"


iOS gives each app 4 extea queues on top of the main one - these are global queues: 

QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE; top priority 
QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED; regular priority 
QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND; low 
QOS_CLASS_UTILITY; lowest

We can access these queues by the function "dispatch_get_global_queue()" 

To get the main queue , you can use the "dispatch_get_main_queue" for this 

To add closure to the queue , use the dispatch_async() function; it returns immediately after adding closure 


When a framework can run in the background, it is said to be thread-safe. 
Some frameworks, however, can only run in the apple main queue, UI kit and core data are part of this. YOu cant run anything from the UIKit in the background, or the app will crash intermittently. For core data, NSManagedObject can only be used in the same queue in which it was created . If it was created in the backgound, only use it in the background. It it was created in the Main queue, only use it in the main queue. 




								NOTES FROM LESSON 3



A refresher on swift syntax:
say we have something like let url = NSURL(string: BigImahes.seaLion.raValue)
in this case, the URL may be a nil. i.e. a let value can take a nil. Here. url is an optional
When this is used as a parameter, it can happen that the function does not take in optinals. So you will have to unwrap it with an exclamation point. 
let imageData = NSData(contentsOfURl: url!)
It is not good practice to have all these exclamatin points in swift code. You should try to put everything in the "if-let" clauses. 
Note++ - you dont need to nest your if-let clauses. One if-let can have many "lets" separated by commas


If the name ends in view - it belongs in the main queue.

Not all of UIKit is htread unsafe. there are a few exception like UIIMage. But ALL the views are unsafe. 


Something that you need to figure out:

    @IBAction func simpleAsynchronousDownload(sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
        
        let url = NSURL(string: BigImages.shark.rawValue)
        let download = dispatch_queue_create("download", nil)
        dispatch_async(download) { () -> Void in
            let data = NSData(contentsOfURL: url!)
            let image = UIImage(data: data!)
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -> Void in
                self.photoView.image = image!
            })
        }

    }









































									QUESTIONS:

1. In the closure demonstration ( first exercise), why are there only 4 results to the array of closures. The code is executing 5 times so there should be 5 answers correct?
